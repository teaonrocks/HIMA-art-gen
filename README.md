# NFT Art Generator

This repository contains a Python script that allows you to generate NFT art based on the rarity of different layers. The script utilizes the PIL library for image manipulation and automates the process of pinning the generated art to Pinata IPFS. Additionally, it generates the necessary metadata for minting on the Cardano blockchain.
